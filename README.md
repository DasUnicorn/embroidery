# embroidery
This Repo contains all my embroidery files.

Each Project is separated in its own folder and contains the following files:
* .endo - The project file. If you want to update or customize each design, this is the file your are looking for. It contains the embroidery project and can be open by the embroidery software of your choice. Edit the file and export the result in the right format for your embroidery machine.
* .vp4 / .vp3 - The file you want for a Paff product
* .pes / .pec - The file you want for a Brother product
* .dst - The file for a Tajima product
* .png / .jpg - A picture that shows you the result I achived with the given files. The design is tested with the Brother Innovis NV 800E, Madeira embroidery thread and usually tested on felt.

I document my journey with the Brother Innovis NV 800E in the [Chaostreff Flensburg wiki](https://wiki.chaostreff-flensburg.de/werkzeuge/stickmaschine/).
